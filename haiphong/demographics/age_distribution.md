## Overview

Haiphong's population shows a balanced age distribution with distinct trends important for property investors. Understanding these demographics helps predict housing demand and community services needed.

## Population Breakdown by Age and Gender

| Age Group | Male (%) | Female (%) | Total (%) |
|-----------|----------|------------|-----------|
| 0-14      | 11%      | 11%        | 22%       |

## Trends Over the Years

Recent data indicates a gradual aging population, with the 65+ age group increasing from 7% in 2010 to 11% in 2025. However, this is partially offset by an influx of younger workers aged 25-44 moving in for industrial and service sector jobs.

Migration from rural areas has contributed to an increase in the working-age population, supporting economic growth and housing demand particularly for smaller apartments and rental units.

## Investment Implications

An aging population suggests rising demand for accessible housing and senior living services. The robust working-age influx drives demand for affordable housing, rental apartments, and starter homes.

Investors should monitor neighborhood demographics to balance portfolios between long-term care facilities and high-turnover rental units catering to younger residents.

## Conclusion

Haiphong’s demographic trends present diverse opportunities for property investment. Careful zoning and market analysis can capitalize on both aging and young professional populations.
